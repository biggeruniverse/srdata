"""
This module contains a collection of classes and functions that are generally
swapped out to a different implementation if an application is running under
the stackless-framework.  It is intended for things such as sleep(), whose
Stackless-implementation won't work unless the framework is being ticket.
Contrast this with stacklesslib.locks.Lock() which also works as a normal
thread locking primitive.
The replacement is indirected, so that client code can bind directly
to the functions here, e.g. use "from stacklesslib.app import sleep"
