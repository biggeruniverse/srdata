"""
This file implements waiting according to the "wait protocol"
The wait protocol simply means implementing the "add_done_callback"

A WaitSite class is provided, as well as a WaitableTasklet and
ValueTasklet.

Objects that conform to the wait protocol also include stacklesslib.locks.Event and
stacklesslib.futures.future.
